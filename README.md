# TurtleStory
A python turtle lab
Python turtle can be a self-design tool to build many projects.
This turtle lab is my final project from python course.
It demostartes that a turtle is having fun in a playground. 
It contains four main parts.
The code is made of the function of drawing the sun, the function of drawing the woods, the function of drawing the pool and the function of drawing the house. 
And the last thread to put all those function together is how turtle is moving among all those four places.
